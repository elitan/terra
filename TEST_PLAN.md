# Terra Phase 2: Advanced PostgreSQL Features

## Overview

Phase 1 (constraint foundation) is complete with 70+ passing tests. This document outlines the next critical PostgreSQL features needed for production-ready applications.

## ðŸŽ‰ Phase 1 Complete
**All constraint functionality implemented**: Foreign Keys, Check Constraints, Unique Constraints, Dependency Resolution, and Destructive Operation Safety.

## Next Features to Implement

### 1. ENUM Types (`src/test/types/enum-types.test.ts`) 
**Priority: HIGH - START HERE**

Tests needed:
- Basic ENUM type creation and usage
- ENUM values in column definitions
- Adding/removing ENUM values (requires careful ordering)
- ENUM type modifications and migrations
- ENUM value constraints and validation
- Cross-table ENUM type usage
- ENUM type dependency resolution

**Why Critical**: ENUM types are used in almost every production PostgreSQL application but are completely missing from Terra.

### 2. JSON/JSONB Column Types (`src/test/types/json-types.test.ts`)
**Priority: HIGH**

Tests needed:
- JSON and JSONB column creation
- JSON path constraints and validation
- JSON schema evolution (adding/removing keys)
- JSON indexing with GIN indexes
- JSON operator support in constraints
- JSONB vs JSON performance considerations
- JSON migration safety (data preservation)

**Why Critical**: Modern applications heavily rely on JSON storage, essential for contemporary web applications.

### 3. Array Types (`src/test/types/array-types.test.ts`)
**Priority: HIGH**

Tests needed:
- Array column definitions (INTEGER[], TEXT[], etc.)
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Array constraints and validation
- Array element type changes
- Array index creation (GIN indexes)
- Array length constraints
- Array element uniqueness constraints

**Why Critical**: Arrays are a fundamental PostgreSQL feature that differentiates it from other databases.

### 4. View Support (`src/test/objects/views.test.ts`)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Tests needed:
- Simple view creation and modification
- View dependency resolution (views depending on tables/other views)
- Materialized views
- View column aliasing
- View security and permissions
- View recreation vs modification
- Recursive views (CTEs)

**Why Important**: Views are basic database objects essential for data abstraction and security.

### 5. Generated Columns (`src/test/columns/generated-columns.test.ts`)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Tests needed:
- STORED vs VIRTUAL generated columns
- Generated column expressions
- Generated column dependencies
- Generated column indexing
- Generated column constraints
- Generated column migration safety
- Performance implications

**Why Important**: Generated columns are increasingly used for computed values and performance optimization.

### 6. EXCLUDE Constraints (`src/test/constraints/exclude-constraints.test.ts`)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

Tests needed:
- Basic EXCLUDE constraint creation
- Temporal data exclusions (overlapping ranges)
- Spatial data exclusions (geometric overlaps)
- Custom operator EXCLUDE constraints
- EXCLUDE constraint modifications
- Performance considerations with large datasets

**Why Important**: Essential for temporal data integrity and advanced uniqueness requirements.

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence for maximum impact:**

1. **ENUM Types** (HIGH) - Most commonly needed, foundational for other features
2. **JSON/JSONB Types** (HIGH) - Modern app requirement, widely used
3. **Array Types** (HIGH) - Core PostgreSQL differentiator
4. **Views** (MEDIUM) - Basic database functionality  
5. **Generated Columns** (MEDIUM) - Performance optimization
6. **EXCLUDE Constraints** (MEDIUM) - Advanced temporal/spatial integrity

## Success Criteria

- [ ] ENUM type creation, modification, and migration
- [ ] JSON/JSONB column support with constraints  
- [ ] Array type support with proper indexing
- [ ] View creation and dependency management
- [ ] Generated column support with proper dependencies
- [ ] EXCLUDE constraint implementation

**Target: Add 50+ tests across these features to reach ~120 total tests**

## Getting Started

Start with **ENUM Types** - create `src/test/types/enum-types.test.ts` and implement the foundational type system that other advanced features will build upon.
